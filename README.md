# UCLP DSS

Repo to organize all data/code related to the Upper CLP Decision Support System. 
## Primarily project goals:
- Create dashboard for all WQ and quanity data relevant to CLP Municipal water supplies
- Collate all relevant in-stream water quality data to create models
- Create models of in-stream water quality based on in-situ sonde data and physical conditions

## Data: 
Sensor data is housed in Poudre Sonde Network OneDrive folder managed by KW
ROSS Grab sample data is updated bi-annually to Zenodo folder (https://zenodo.org/records/12752311)
Fort Collins Grab sample data is managed/shared by Jared Heath and Diana Schmidt

## Code:
Currently the repo is broken into three folder:
### Source:
This is where scripts to pull in data and other functions will live. 
### Dashboard:
This will store code to create a prototype dashboard (Shiny?) for treatment operators
### Modeling: 
This is where we will organize our data and test models to predict grab sample analytes from sensor data

##License:
The code in this repository is covered by the MIT use license. We request that all downstream uses of this work be available to the public when possible.
